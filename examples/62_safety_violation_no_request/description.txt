Example 62: Safety Violation - Response Without Request
========================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

P2 produces a 'response' event but no process ever produces
'request'. The implication response -> (TRUE S request) fails.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
  (idle)     (idle)
    |           |
   e2         e3
  (idle)   (response)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

At e3, response is true but request was never true
anywhere, so (TRUE S request) is false. The property
is VIOLATED in all linearizations.
