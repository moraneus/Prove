Example 26: Star Topology
===========================
Processes: Hub, S1, S2, S3
Events: 12
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

A hub process broadcasts to three spoke processes. Each spoke receives the
message and acknowledges. The property checks that "received" occurred at
some point -- which it did (at s1_r, s2_r, or s3_r).

This tests a four-process star topology with one-to-many messaging.
