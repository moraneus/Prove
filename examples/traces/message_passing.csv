# PROVE Example Trace: Client-Server Message Passing
#
# Demonstrates asynchronous message passing:
# 1. Client sends a request to Server
# 2. Server receives the request and processes it
# 3. Server sends a response back to Client
# 4. Client receives the response
#
# Message causality creates ordering: send < receive
# Vector clocks capture this: receive merges sender's clock
#
# system_processes: Client|Server
