# PROVE Example Trace: Simple Two-Process Execution
#
# This trace demonstrates a basic two-process system where:
# - P1 initializes, becomes ready, then confirms
# - P2 initializes, then completes
#
# Format: eid,processes,vc,timestamp,props,event_type,msg_partner
# - eid: unique event identifier
# - processes: process this event belongs to
# - vc: vector clock (Process:Count pairs separated by ;)
# - timestamp: global timestamp (used for epsilon-based ordering)
# - props: propositions true after this event (separated by |)
# - event_type: local, send, or receive
# - msg_partner: target (for send) or source (for receive) process
#
# system_processes: P1|P2
# epsilon: 2.0
