Example 37: Epsilon Mixed with VC
====================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 8
Epsilon: 1.0
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Combines vector clock ordering (s1->r1 via message) with epsilon ordering
(time gaps > 1.0 between processes). The property checks that both "sent"
and "received" precede "final" -- guaranteed by both VC and epsilon.

This tests the combination of vector clock and epsilon orderings.
