Example 97: Once Satisfied Via Remote Process
===============================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The proposition 'special' only appears on P2 at e1.
Since the global state at the initial frontier includes
e1, special is true there. TRUE S special holds.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
  (idle)    (special)
    |           |
   e2         e3
  (idle)     (idle)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

At the initial frontier {e0, e1}, special is true.
So TRUE S special = SATISFIED.
