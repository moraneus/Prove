Example 93: Since Immediately Satisfied
=========================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

At e0, both a and b are true. So "a S b" is immediately
satisfied (b is the trigger, a is the maintainer, and
b just became true at the current state).

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(a,b)    e1(a)
    |           |
   e2(a)      e3(a)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

At the initial frontier {e0, e1}: b is true (from e0),
and a is true. So a S b = true. It remains true at
subsequent events since a continues and b was seen.
SATISFIED.
