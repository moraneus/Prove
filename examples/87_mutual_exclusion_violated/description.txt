Example 87: Mutual Exclusion Violated
=======================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

P1 ends with cs1 and P2 ends with cs2. Since these are the
FINAL events on their respective processes, the final frontier
MUST contain both e3(cs1) and e4(cs2). The global state at
every final frontier includes both cs1 and cs2 simultaneously.

Therefore !(cs1 & cs2) is false at every final frontier,
and the property is VIOLATED in every linearization.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0         e1          e2
  (idle)     (idle)      (idle)
    |           |           |
   e3         e4          e5
  (cs1)      (cs2)      (idle)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

Final frontier: {e3, e4, e5}. Global state = {cs1, cs2, idle}.
cs1 & cs2 = true. !(cs1 & cs2) = false.

No linearization can avoid this: e3 and e4 are always the
maximal events for P1 and P2. VIOLATED.
