Example 47: Yesterday at First State (Edge Case)
===================================================
Processes: P1
Events: 3
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The Yesterday operator (@) returns false at the initial state because there
is no previous state. However, at e1, @start checks e0 which has "start" --
so @start is true at e1. The property is evaluated at the final frontier,
and @start at e2 checks e1 (middle, not start) = false.

The final verdict depends on evaluation at the last state. At e2, @start
is false because e1 has {middle}, not {start}. So the property is VIOLATED.

Edge case: Yesterday operator at initial/boundary states.
