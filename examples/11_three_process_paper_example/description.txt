Example 11: Three-Process Paper Example
=========================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 9
Epsilon: 2.0
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Based on the paper's Appendix B example. Three processes where P1 sends a
message to P2 (alpha1 -> beta1), P3 operates independently. The property
checks that receiving the message (r1) implies the send (send_msg) happened
earlier. Vector clock causality guarantees this.

This tests a three-process trace with mixed message passing and independence.
