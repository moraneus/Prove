Example 63: Broadcast - One Sender Two Receivers
==================================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 7
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends separate messages to P2 and P3 (broadcast pattern).
Both receivers get 'notified' after P1's 'init'.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0         e1          e2
  (init)     (idle)      (idle)
    |           |           |
   e3 --------> e5          |
 (notify)  (notified)      |
    |                       |
   e4 ------------------> e6
 (notify)             (notified)

Cross-process edges:
  e3 -> e5  (message: P1 to P2)
  e4 -> e6  (message: P1 to P3)

init was true at e0. Both e5 and e6 see 'notified'.
The property is SATISFIED.
