Example 18: Biconditional Temporal
=====================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

At e2-e3 "locked" is true and "TRUE S acquire" is also true (acquire at e1),
so the biconditional holds. But at e4, "locked" is false while
"TRUE S acquire" is still true (acquire happened in the past). The
biconditional fails at e4.

This tests the biconditional operator with a temporal subformula.
