Example 35: Epsilon Exact Boundary
=====================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: 2.0
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The time difference between e1 (t=1.0) and e2 (t=3.0) is exactly 2.0,
which equals epsilon. The ordering rule requires dt > epsilon (strict
inequality), so dt=2.0 does NOT force ordering. Events e1 and e2 remain
concurrent, and their propositions can coexist in a global state.

This tests the exact boundary condition of epsilon ordering (strict >).
