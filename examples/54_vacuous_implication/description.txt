Example 54: Vacuous Implication (Edge Case)
=============================================
Processes: P1
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The proposition "unicorn" never appears in any event. Since the antecedent
of the implication is always false, the implication is vacuously true at
every state. This tests the correct handling of vacuous truth in
implication.

Edge case: implication with permanently false antecedent.
