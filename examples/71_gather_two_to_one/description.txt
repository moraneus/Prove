Example 71: Gather Pattern (Two Report to One)
================================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 7
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P2 and P3 each send data to P1. After receiving both,
P1 marks 'complete'.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0         e1          e2
  (wait)    (data_b)    (data_c)
    |           |           |
    |          e3          e4
    |        (data_b)    (data_c)
    |           |           |
   e5 <--------'           |
 (data_b)                  |
    |                       |
   e6 <--------------------'
 (data_c,
  complete)

Cross-process edges:
  e3 -> e5  (message: P2 to P1)
  e4 -> e6  (message: P3 to P1)

At e6, P1 has received both data_b and data_c.
The property is SATISFIED.
