==================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

The property is the constant FALSE, which is violated regardless of the
trace content. This tests the tool's handling of trivial contradictory
properties.

Edge case: contradictory property.
