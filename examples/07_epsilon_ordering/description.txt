Example 07: Epsilon Ordering
==============================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 5
Epsilon: 0.3
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

With epsilon=0.3, the time difference between e1 (t=1.0) and e2 (t=1.5)
is 0.5 > 0.3, so e1 is forced to precede e2. This means in every
linearization, "first" appears before "second", making the Once property
satisfied.

This tests epsilon-based temporal ordering between independent processes.
