Example 42: Minimal Two Processes (Edge Case)
================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 2
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The minimal two-process trace: just one initial event per process. Both
events are concurrent (same timestamp, no messages). The property "up"
is satisfied because both initial events have "up" as a proposition.

Edge case: minimal multi-process trace.
