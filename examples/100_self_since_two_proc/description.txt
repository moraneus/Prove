Example 100: Self-Referential Since (Two Processes)
=====================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

p S p means "p has held since p was true." Since p is always
true (all events have p), this is trivially satisfied.
p serves as both the trigger and the maintainer.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(p)      e1(p)
    |           |
   e2(p)      e3(p)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

p is always true. p S p is satisfied at the first state
where p is true (immediately). SATISFIED.
