Example 50: Historically with One Violation (Edge Case)
=========================================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

"ok" holds at every event except e2 (which has "broken" instead). The
Historically operator !(TRUE S !ok) requires ok to have been true at ALL
past points. The single violation at e2 causes the property to fail.

Edge case: Historically with exactly one violation point.
