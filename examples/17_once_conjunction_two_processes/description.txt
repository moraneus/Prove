Example 17: Once Conjunction Across Processes
===============================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: 10.0
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 has "ready" at e1 and P2 has "willing" at e2. With epsilon=10, these
events are concurrent. There exists a linearization where the frontier
contains both e1 and e2, making "ready & willing" true in that global
state. The existential Once pattern is therefore satisfied.

This tests the Once operator with propositions from different processes.
