Example 02: Two Concurrent Processes
======================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: 10.0
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Two independent processes run without any message passing. P1 produces
proposition "a" and P2 produces "b". With epsilon=10 the events are
concurrent, so there exists a linearization where "a" and "b" are
simultaneously true in a global state (their frontiers overlap).

This tests existential semantics over concurrent events.
