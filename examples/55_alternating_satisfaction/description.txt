Example 55: Alternating Satisfaction (Edge Case)
===================================================
Processes: P1
Events: 10
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The "toggle" proposition alternates between true (even events) and false
(odd events) over 10 events. The Once property (TRUE S toggle) checks
if toggle was ever true, which it was many times. Even at the final state
(e9, no toggle), the Once remembers past truth.

Edge case: rapidly alternating proposition truth values.
