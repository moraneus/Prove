Example 36: Epsilon Three Processes
======================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 9
Epsilon: 1.0
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

With epsilon=1.0, events with timestamp differences > 1.0 are ordered.
e1(t=1) precedes e2(t=3) precedes e3(t=5) across all processes. At e3,
both "a" (from e1) and "b" (from e2) have already occurred.

This tests epsilon ordering across three independent processes.
