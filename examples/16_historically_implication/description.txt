Example 16: Historically + Implication
========================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Uses the Historically pattern H(phi) = !(TRUE S !phi) with phi being
"request -> @idle". At every point where "request" holds (e1 and e3),
the previous state had "idle" (e0 and e2 respectively). So the
implication holds at every step, and Historically is satisfied.

This tests Historically combined with implication and Yesterday.
