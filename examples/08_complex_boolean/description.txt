Example 08: Complex Boolean
==============================
Processes: P1
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Event e2 has both propositions "a" and "b" true simultaneously. The property
checks that at some point in the past, both a and b held at the same time.
This is satisfied at e2.

This tests conjunction within a temporal operator.
