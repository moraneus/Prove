Example 32: FIFO Message Ordering
====================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 8
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends two messages to P2. FIFO ordering guarantees the first message
is received before the second. The property verifies this: receiving the
second message implies the first was already received.

This tests FIFO ordering guarantees with multiple messages.
