Example 49: Once Never True (Edge Case)
==========================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

The proposition "magic" never appears in any event. The Once pattern
(TRUE S magic) checks if "magic" was ever true in the past. Since it
never is, the property is violated on all paths.

Edge case: temporal operator referencing a non-existent proposition.
