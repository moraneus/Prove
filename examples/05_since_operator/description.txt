Example 05: Since Operator
============================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Tests the Since operator (phi S psi). "start" is true at e0, then "running"
is true at e1-e3, then "stop" at e4. At event e3, "running S start" holds
because "start" was true at e0 and "running" has been continuous since.

At the final state (e4), the formula evaluates based on the last event's
propositions. Since "running" is no longer true at e4, the Since breaks --
but it WAS true at e3, so there exists a path where it holds.
