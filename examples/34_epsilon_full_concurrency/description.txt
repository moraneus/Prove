Example 34: Epsilon Full Concurrency
=======================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

With epsilon=infinity, timestamps never force ordering between independent
processes. Even though e2 has timestamp 100 while e1 has timestamp 1, they
remain concurrent (no vector clock relationship, no message). A frontier
can contain both e1 and e2 simultaneously.

This tests the extreme case of infinite epsilon (maximum concurrency).
