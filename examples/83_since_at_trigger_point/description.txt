Example 83: Since Satisfied at Trigger Point
==============================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The trigger appears at the very first event (e0) along with
'hold'. Every subsequent event also has 'hold'. So
"hold S trigger" is satisfied: trigger was true at e0, and
hold has been true ever since.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
  (trigger,  (hold)
   hold)
    |           |
   e2         e3
  (hold)     (hold)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

trigger is true at e0. hold is true at e0,e1,e2,e3.
In any linearization starting with e0: hold S trigger
is SATISFIED from e0 onward.
