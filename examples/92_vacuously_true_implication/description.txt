Example 92: Vacuously True Implication (Two Processes)
=======================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The antecedent 'z' is never true at any event. Therefore
z -> x is vacuously true at every state (false -> anything
= true).

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(x)      e1(y)
    |           |
   e2(x)      e3(y)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

z is never true, so z -> x evaluates to true -> true = true
at states where x holds, and false -> x = true everywhere.
SATISFIED.
