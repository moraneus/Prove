Example 88: Double Yesterday (@@p) - Violated
================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

Tests @@p which requires p to be true two states ago.
P1 has p at e0, then idle at e2, then check at e4.

The formula check -> @@p requires that at the final frontier
where check is true, p was true exactly two steps back in
the linearization.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(p)      e1(idle)
    |           |
   e2(idle)   e3(idle)
    |           |
   e4(check)  e5(idle)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

Analysis: The final frontier is always {e4, e5}. At this
frontier, check=true (from e4). For @@p to be true, @p
must be true at the frontier just before {e4, e5}.

The frontier before {e4,e5} is either {e4,e3} or {e2,e5}.
At {e4,e3}: p is false (check from e4, idle from e3).
At {e2,e5}: p is false (idle from both).

So @p is false at the step before {e4,e5}, which means
@@p is false at {e4,e5}.

In no linearization can check -> @@p be satisfied at the
final frontier. VIOLATED.
