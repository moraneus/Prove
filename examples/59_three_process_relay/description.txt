Example 59: Three-Process Relay
================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 7
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends a message to P2, which relays it to P3.
This creates a causal chain P1 -> P2 -> P3.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0         e1          e2
  (start)    (idle)      (idle)
    |           |           |
   e3 --------> e4          |
  (msg)      (msg)         |
                |           |
               e5 --------> e6
             (relay)     (relay)

Cross-process edges:
  e3 -> e4  (message: P1 to P2)
  e5 -> e6  (message: P2 to P3)

Causal chain: e0 -> e3 -> e4 -> e5 -> e6
At e6, start was true at e0, so relay -> (TRUE S start)
is SATISFIED.
