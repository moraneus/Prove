Example 86: Epsilon Exact Boundary (Not Ordered)
==================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: 2.0
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

With epsilon=2.0, e2(t=1.0) and e3(t=3.0) have dt=2.0.
Since 2.0 is NOT > 2.0 (must be strictly greater), these
events remain concurrent.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(a)      e1(b)
    |           |
   e2(a)      e3(b)

No cross-process edges.
(dt(e2,e3) = 2.0 = epsilon, NOT > epsilon, so no ordering)

Both a and b are in the global state at the final frontier
{e2, e3}. The property a & b is SATISFIED.
