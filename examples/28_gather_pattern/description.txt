Example 28: Gather Pattern
============================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 9
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P2 and P3 independently compute results and send them to P1 (gather).
When P1 has received both ("all_done"), the property checks that both
"result_b" and "result_c" occurred in the past. The causal ordering from
messages guarantees both results were produced before the gather completes.

This tests a many-to-one gather/reduce communication pattern.
