Example 74: Since With Gap - Existential Recovery
===================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 has 'trigger' at e0 and 'hold' throughout. P2 has 'hold'
at e1, a gap at e3 (no propositions), then 'hold' again at e5.

The formula "hold S trigger" requires that trigger was true
at some past point, and hold has been true continuously since.

Key insight (existential semantics): Since P1 and P2 are fully
concurrent, there exists a linearization where e3 (the gap on P2)
is processed while P1 still has 'hold', keeping hold true in the
global state. Even though P2 has a gap, the union of propositions
across processes keeps hold true.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1              P2
    |               |
   e0(trigger,     e1(hold)
      hold)         |
    |              e3()
   e2(hold)         |
    |              e5(hold)
   e4(hold)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

In linearization e0,e1,e2,e3,e4,e5:
  - {e0,e1}: trigger=true, hold=true. hold S trigger = true.
  - {e2,e1}: hold=true (from both). hold S trigger = true.
  - {e2,e3}: hold=true (from e2 on P1). hold S trigger = true.
  - {e4,e3}: hold=true (from e4 on P1). hold S trigger = true.
  - {e4,e5}: hold=true. hold S trigger = true.

The gap on P2 at e3 never causes hold to be false in the
global state because P1 always contributes hold. SATISFIED.
