Example 06: Historically Operator
===================================
Processes: P1
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Every event in the trace has "ok" as a proposition. The Historically
pattern !(TRUE S !phi) checks that phi has been true at every point.
Since ok is never false, the property is satisfied.

This tests the Historically (H) derived operator: H phi = !(TRUE S !phi).
