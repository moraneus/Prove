Example 65: Historically Violated (Both Processes End Fail)
============================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

Both P1 and P2 end with 'fail' (not 'ok'). Since these are
the final events on their respective processes, the final
frontier MUST be {e2, e3} with global state = {fail}.
At this frontier, ok is false and !ok is true, so
TRUE S !ok = true, making !(TRUE S !ok) = false.

No linearization can avoid this because both processes'
maximal events have fail.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(ok)     e1(ok)
    |           |
   e2(fail)   e3(fail)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

The final frontier is always {e2, e3}. Global state = {fail}.
ok is NOT in the global state, so !ok is true.
!(TRUE S !ok) evaluates to false. VIOLATED.
