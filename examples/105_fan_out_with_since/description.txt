Example 105: Fan-Out With Since Property
==========================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 9
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends messages to both P2 and P3. After receiving,
both processes become 'active'. The Since property checks
that 'active' has held continuously since 'origin'.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0         e1          e2
  (origin)   (wait)      (wait)
    |           |           |
   e3 --------> e5          |
  (origin)   (active)      |
    |                       |
   e4 ------------------> e6
  (origin)             (active)
                |           |
               e7          e8
            (active)    (active)

Cross-process edges:
  e3 -> e5  (message: P1 to P2)
  e4 -> e6  (message: P1 to P3)

In a linearization starting with e0(origin), then
proceeding to the receives (e5, e6 with active), and
then e7, e8: origin was true at e0, and active holds
from e5/e6 onward. active S origin is SATISFIED in at
least one linearization.
