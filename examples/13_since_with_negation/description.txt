Example 13: Since with Negation
=================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The property "!error S initialized" checks that "initialized" was true at
some past point, and "error" has been false continuously since then. Since
"error" never appears in any event's propositions, !error is always true,
and "initialized" holds at e0.

This tests negation within the Since operator.
