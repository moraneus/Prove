Example 76: Negation of Since (No Error Since Init)
=====================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Both processes initialize and then have 'ok' events.
'error' never appears. The property !(error S init) says
"it is NOT the case that error has held since init."
Since error is always false, (error S init) is false,
so the negation is true.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(init)   e1(init)
    |           |
   e2(ok)     e3(ok)
    |           |
   e4(ok)     e5(ok)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

error S init would require error to hold continuously since
init. Since error never holds, the Since is false. The
negation makes the property SATISFIED.
