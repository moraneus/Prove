Example 72: Biconditional With Message
========================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends an 'acquire' message to P2. P2 becomes 'locked'
upon receiving it and stays locked. The biconditional
checks that locked holds exactly when acquire occurred.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
  (idle)     (idle)
    |           |
   e2 --------> e3
 (acquire)  (acquire,
              locked)
                |
               e4
            (locked)

Cross-process edges:
  e2 -> e3  (message: P1 to P2)

At e3 and e4: locked is true and (TRUE S acquire) is true.
At e0,e1: locked is false and (TRUE S acquire) is false.
The biconditional holds everywhere. SATISFIED.
