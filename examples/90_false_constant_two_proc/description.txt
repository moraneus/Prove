Example 90: FALSE Constant (Two Processes)
============================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 2
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

The property is simply FALSE, which is never satisfied
regardless of the trace content.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(a)      e1(b)

No cross-process edges.

FALSE is always VIOLATED.
