Example 15: Yesterday + Since Combined
========================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

Tests the combination @(p S q). At e4 ("final"), @(p S q) looks back to e3.
At e3, the propositions are {check} -- neither p nor q hold. Since "p S q"
requires either q to be true now, or p to be true now AND p S q held before,
and neither condition is met at e3, the formula evaluates to false.

This tests the interaction between Yesterday and Since operators.
