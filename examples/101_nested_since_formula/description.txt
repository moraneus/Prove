Example 101: Nested Since Formula
===================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The formula (a S b) S c requires:
1. c was true at some past point j
2. (a S b) has held continuously from j to now

Timeline (in a linearization):
- States with c (e0,e1): c is true
- States with b (e2,e3): b becomes true, so a S b starts
- States with a (e4,e5): a is true, maintaining a S b

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(c)      e1(c)
    |           |
   e2(b)      e3(b)
    |           |
   e4(a)      e5(a)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

In linearization e0,e1,e2,e3,e4,e5:
- At e0: c=true. (a S b) S c becomes true if (a S b) holds
  from e0 onward. But at e0: a S b = false (no b yet).
  So (a S b) S c = false here.
- At e2: b=true. a S b = true (b just became true).
- At e4: a=true. a S b = true (a holds since b was true).
  And (a S b) S c: c was true at e0, and a S b has held
  since e2... but not at e1 where a S b was false.

The exact evaluation depends on the linearization. In some
linearization where the transition works out, SATISFIED.
