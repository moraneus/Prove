Example 27: Ring Topology
===========================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 9
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

A token-passing ring: P1 sends a token to P2, which forwards to P3, which
sends back to P1. The property checks that completing the cycle implies the
token existed earlier. The causal chain P1->P2->P3->P1 guarantees this.

This tests ring topology message passing.
