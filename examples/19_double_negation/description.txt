Example 19: Double Negation
==============================
Processes: P1
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Tests that double negation !!phi is equivalent to phi. At the final event
e3, "done" is true, so "!!done" evaluates to true. This verifies that the
parser and evaluator handle nested negation correctly.

This tests negation composability.
