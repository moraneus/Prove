Example 43: All Empty Propositions (Edge Case)
=================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

No event has any propositions. The property "!active" holds because "active"
is never true in any state. This tests the tool's handling of empty
proposition sets.

Edge case: traces with no propositions.
