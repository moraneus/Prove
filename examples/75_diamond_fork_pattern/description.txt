Example 75: Diamond Pattern (Fork)
====================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 7
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 forks work to P2 and P3 by sending messages to both.
This creates a diamond structure where e5 and e6 are
concurrent but both causally follow P1's events.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0         e1          e2
  (start)    (idle)      (idle)
    |           |           |
   e3 --------> e5          |
  (start)   (got_it)       |
    |                       |
   e4 ------------------> e6
  (start)             (got_it)

Cross-process edges:
  e3 -> e5  (message: P1 to P2)
  e4 -> e6  (message: P1 to P3)

Note: e5 and e6 are concurrent (no ordering between them).
start was true at e0,e3,e4. Both got_it events satisfy
the property. SATISFIED.
