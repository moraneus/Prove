Example 56: Concurrent Local Events
====================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Two processes run independently with no messages.
P1 holds 'a', P2 holds 'b'. At the final events, both
processes hold both 'a' and 'b'.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(a)      e1(b)
    |           |
   e2(a)      e3(b)
    |           |
   e4(a,b)   e5(a,b)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).
Since e4 has {a,b}, the formula TRUE S (a & b) is SATISFIED
in any linearization that reaches e4.
