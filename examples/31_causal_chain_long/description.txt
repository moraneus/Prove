Example 31: Long Causal Chain
================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 10
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Alternating send/receive between P1 and P2 forms a long causal chain:
P1->P2->P1->P2->P1. The property checks that the "final" state implies
"start" occurred earlier. The causal chain through messages guarantees this.

This tests long multi-hop causal chains between two processes.
