Example 82: Three Independent Processes
=========================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Three processes with no messages and no epsilon ordering.
All events across processes are fully concurrent.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0(x)      e1(y)       e2(z)
    |           |           |
   e3(x)      e4(y)       e5(z)

No cross-process edges.

The global state at any frontier includes one event from
each process. All frontiers have x, y, z simultaneously.
So x & y & z is SATISFIED.
