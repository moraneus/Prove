Example 14: Chained Since
===========================
Processes: P1
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Tests two independent Since operators combined with conjunction. "a" and "c"
are true at e0, then "b" and "d" are true from e1 through e4. At e4,
"b S a" holds (b continuous since a was true) and "d S c" holds similarly.

This tests conjunction of multiple Since operators.
