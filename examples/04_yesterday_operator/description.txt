Example 04: Yesterday Operator
================================
Processes: P1
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

A four-event chain where each event has a unique proposition. The property
checks that "step3" implies "step2" held in the immediately previous state
(the Yesterday operator @). Since step2 directly precedes step3, this is
satisfied.

This tests the Yesterday (@) temporal operator.
