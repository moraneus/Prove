Example 41: Minimal Single Event (Edge Case)
===============================================
Processes: P1
Events: 1
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The absolute minimum trace: one process, one event. The property simply
checks if "alive" holds. This tests the tool's behavior with the smallest
possible input.

Edge case: minimal trace size.
