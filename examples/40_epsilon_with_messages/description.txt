Example 40: Epsilon with Messages
====================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 8
Epsilon: 1.0
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Combines message causality (s1->r1) with epsilon ordering (time gaps > 1
between processes). msg_sent precedes msg_recv by VC, and local_c (t=6)
precedes done (t=8) by epsilon (dt=2 > eps=1).

This tests the interplay between vector clock and epsilon orderings.
