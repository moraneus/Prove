Example 48: Since Never Triggered (Edge Case)
================================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

The Since operator "a S b" requires b to have been true at some past point
with a holding continuously since. Since b never appears in any event's
propositions, the Since can never be triggered. The property is violated.

Edge case: Since with unreachable trigger condition.
