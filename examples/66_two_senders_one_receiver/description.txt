Example 66: Two Senders to One Receiver
=========================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 7
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 and P3 each send a message to P2. The sends are
concurrent but the receives on P2 are ordered.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0(a)      e1          e2(c)
    |         (idle)        |
   e3 --------> e5          |
   (a)        (a)          |
                |          e4
               e6 <--------
              (c)         (c)

Cross-process edges:
  e3 -> e5  (message: P1 to P2)
  e4 -> e6  (message: P3 to P2)

Note: e3 and e4 are concurrent (different processes,
no causal relation). P2 receives them in order e5, e6.
Both 'a' and 'c' appear in the trace, so the property
is SATISFIED.
