Example 57: Single Message Causality
=====================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends a single message to P2. The receive event inherits
causality from the send event.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
    |           |
   e2 --------> e3
  (send)     (recv)
                |
               e4
             (done)

Cross-process edges:
  e2 -> e3  (message: P1 sends to P2)

When e4(done) is reached, request was true at e2 and e3,
so done -> (TRUE S request) is SATISFIED.
