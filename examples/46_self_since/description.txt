Example 46: Self-Since (Edge Case)
=====================================
Processes: P1
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

"active S active" is equivalent to "active" being true at the current state
(since phi S psi is immediately satisfied when psi holds now). At the final
state e3, "active" is false (only "done" holds), so the property is violated.

Edge case: Since operator with identical operands.
