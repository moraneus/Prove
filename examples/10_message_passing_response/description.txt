Example 10: Message Passing Response
======================================
Processes: Client, Server
Events: 7
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

A client-server interaction where the client sends a request and later
receives a response. The property checks that whenever "response" holds,
"request" must have occurred earlier. Since c_send (with "request") causally
precedes s_send (with "response") via the message chain, the property holds.

This tests the response pattern over message-passing causality.
