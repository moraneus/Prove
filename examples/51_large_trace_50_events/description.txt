Example 51: Large Trace (50 Events)
======================================
Processes: P1
Events: 50
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

A stress test with 50 events on a single process. Events alternate between
"even" and "odd" propositions, with "start" at the beginning, "end" at the
end, and "checkpoint" every 10 events. The property checks that "end"
implies "start" occurred in the past.

Edge case: large trace to test performance and scalability.
