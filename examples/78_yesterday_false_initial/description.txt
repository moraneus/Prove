Example 78: Yesterday False at Initial State
==============================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 2
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

With only initial events, the yesterday operator @ready
evaluates to false because there is no previous state.
This is a fundamental property of the @ operator.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
  (ready)    (ready)

No cross-process edges.

The initial frontier is {e0, e1}. At this point, @ready
is false (no previous state exists). VIOLATED.
