Example 79: Chain of Implications Across Processes
====================================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Each process holds its own proposition. In the global state,
a, b, and c are all true simultaneously (since the frontier
includes one event from each process).

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2          P3
    |           |           |
   e0(a)      e1(b)       e2(c)
    |           |           |
   e3(a)      e4(b)       e5(c)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

The global state always includes one event from each process.
So a, b, and c are all true. (a -> b) is true (T->T=T),
(b -> c) is true (T->T=T). The conjunction is SATISFIED.
