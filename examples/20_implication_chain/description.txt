Example 20: Implication Chain
================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

At e2, propositions are {a, b} but not c. So "b -> c" fails at e2 (b is
true but c is false). The conjunction of the two implications is therefore
violated.

This tests conjunction of implications and their evaluation at each state.
