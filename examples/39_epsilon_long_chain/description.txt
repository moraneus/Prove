Example 39: Epsilon Creates Long Chain
=========================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 9
Epsilon: 0.5
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

With epsilon=0.5, consecutive events across processes (1s apart each) form
a time-based chain: e1(t=1) -> e2(t=2) -> e3(t=3) -> e4(t=4) -> e5(t=5)
-> e6(t=6). The property checks that step1 preceded step6.

This tests how small epsilon creates long cross-process causal chains.
