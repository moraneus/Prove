Example 69: Once Never Satisfied (Two Processes)
==================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

The proposition 'goal' never appears in any event.
Therefore TRUE S goal (i.e., Once(goal)) is always false.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(a)      e1(b)
    |           |
   e2(a)      e3(b)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

'goal' is never true at any event, so TRUE S goal is
VIOLATED in every linearization.
