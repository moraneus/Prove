Example 03: Client-Server Messages
====================================
Processes: Client, Server
Events: 7
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

A classic client-server request/response pattern. The client sends a
request, the server receives it, processes, sends a response, and the
client receives the response. Vector clocks enforce causal ordering
across the message send/receive pairs.

This tests message causality and the response property pattern.
