Example 68: Implication With Yesterday
========================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends a request to P2. P2 receives it (gaining 'req')
and in the next step produces 'ack'. The property checks
that ack implies the previous state had req.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
  (idle)     (idle)
    |           |
   e2 --------> e3
  (req)      (req)
                |
               e4
             (ack)

Cross-process edges:
  e2 -> e3  (message: P1 to P2)

In the linearization ending ...e3, e4: at e4, @req checks
the previous state which included e3(req). True.
So ack -> @req is SATISFIED.
