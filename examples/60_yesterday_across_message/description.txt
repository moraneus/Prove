Example 60: Yesterday Across Message Boundary
===============================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Tests the yesterday operator (@) where the previous state
involves a cross-process message delivery.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
  (setup)    (idle)
    |           |
   e2 --------> e3
  (ready)    (go)
                |
               e4
             (done)

Cross-process edges:
  e2 -> e3  (message: P1 to P2)

In the linearization ...e3, e4: @go at e4 checks if go
was true in the state before e4. Since e3 has 'go' and
e3 immediately precedes e4 on P2, done -> @go is SATISFIED.
