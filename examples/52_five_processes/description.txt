Example 52: Five Processes (Edge Case)
=========================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5
Events: 10
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Five independent processes, each with an initial "ready" event followed by
a "working" event. All are fully concurrent. The property checks that
"ready" occurred at some point, which it did for all processes.

Edge case: many concurrent processes with wide vector clocks.
