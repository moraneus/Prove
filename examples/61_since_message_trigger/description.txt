Example 61: Since With Message Trigger
========================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The trigger proposition arrives at P2 via a message from P1.
After that, P2 maintains 'monitor' continuously.
The Since formula checks that monitor has held since trigger.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0         e1
  (idle)    (monitor)
    |           |
   e2 --------> e3
 (trigger)  (trigger,
              monitor)
                |
               e4
            (monitor)
                |
               e5
            (monitor)

Cross-process edges:
  e2 -> e3  (message: P1 to P2)

At e3, trigger becomes true and monitor holds.
At e4, e5: monitor continues. So monitor S trigger
is SATISFIED from e3 onward.
