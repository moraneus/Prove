Example 89: TRUE Constant (Two Processes)
===========================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The property is simply TRUE, which is trivially satisfied
regardless of what propositions the events carry.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0()       e1()
    |           |
   e2()       e3()

No cross-process edges. No propositions on any event.

TRUE is always SATISFIED.
