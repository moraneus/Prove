Example 24: Message Chain (Three Processes)
=============================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3
Events: 9
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

A message relay: P1 sends to P2, which forwards to P3. The property checks
that P3 receiving ("delivered") implies "origin" on P1 occurred earlier.
This tests transitive causality through message chains -- P1->P2->P3.

This tests three-process message relay and transitive causal ordering.
