Example 23: Bidirectional Messages
=====================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 8
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends ping to P2, P2 responds with pong to P1. The property checks
that receiving "got_pong" means "ping" was true earlier. The causal chain
ping -> got_ping -> pong -> got_pong guarantees this.

This tests bidirectional message passing with causal ordering.
