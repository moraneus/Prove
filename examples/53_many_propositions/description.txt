Example 53: Many Propositions (Edge Case)
============================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Event e0 has 8 propositions (a through h) all true simultaneously. Later
events split these across different subsets. The property checks that all 8
were simultaneously true at some past point -- which they were at e0.

Edge case: large number of propositions per event.
