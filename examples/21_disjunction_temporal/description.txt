Example 21: Disjunction Temporal
===================================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

"done" never appears in the trace, so "TRUE S done" (Once done) is false.
However, "progress" appears at e1-e3, so "TRUE S progress" (Once progress)
is true. The disjunction is satisfied because the right disjunct holds.

This tests disjunction of Once patterns.
