Example 38: Epsilon with Same Timestamps
==========================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 6
Epsilon: 0.5
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

All events have timestamp 0.0, so no time difference exceeds epsilon.
Even with epsilon=0.5, zero time differences don't force any ordering.
Cross-process events remain fully concurrent, and any combination of
propositions from different processes can coexist in a global state.

This edge case tests epsilon with identical timestamps.
