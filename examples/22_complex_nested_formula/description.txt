Example 22: Complex Nested Formula
=====================================
Processes: P1
Events: 6
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

At e1, "ready" is true and @initialized checks e0 which has "initialized" --
so "ready & @initialized" is true at e1. From e2 onward, "confirmed" is true
continuously. At e5 (done|confirmed), "confirmed S (ready & @initialized)"
holds because confirmed has been true since the anchor at e1.

This tests deep nesting of temporal and boolean operators.
