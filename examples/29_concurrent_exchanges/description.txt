Example 29: Concurrent Exchanges
===================================
Processes: P1, P2, P3, P4
Events: 12
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Two completely independent request-response exchanges run concurrently:
P1<->P2 and P3<->P4. The property checks both completed. Since the
exchanges are independent (no shared processes), they are fully concurrent
and there exists a linearization where both complete.

This tests four-process concurrency with independent message pairs.
