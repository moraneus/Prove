Example 01: Single Process Workflow
====================================
Processes: P1
Events: 3
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

A minimal single-process trace with three sequential events: init, working,
done. The property checks that whenever "done" holds, "working" must have
held at some earlier point. Since the events occur in order init -> working
-> done, the property is satisfied.

This tests the basic Once (TRUE S phi) temporal pattern.
