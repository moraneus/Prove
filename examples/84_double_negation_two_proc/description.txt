Example 84: Double Negation
=============================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Tests that !!p is equivalent to p. Since P1 always has 'p',
and the global state includes P1's event, !!p should be true.

Partial Order Graph:
--------------------

    P1          P2
    |           |
   e0(p)      e1(q)
    |           |
   e2(p)      e3(q)

No cross-process edges (fully concurrent).

Global state includes p (from P1). !!p = !(!p) = !(false)
= true. SATISFIED.
