Example 25: Multiple Messages Same Direction
===============================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 8
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

P1 sends three messages to P2 in sequence (msg1, msg2, msg3). P2 receives
them in FIFO order. The property checks that receiving the third message
implies the first was sent earlier. FIFO ordering and vector clocks ensure
this causal chain.

This tests FIFO message ordering with multiple messages.
