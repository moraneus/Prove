Example 30: Two Clients, One Server
======================================
Processes: C1, C2, Server
Events: 14
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Two clients independently request service from a single server. The server
handles them sequentially (C1 first, then C2). The property checks that
"served" occurred at some point and is currently true. Both clients
reach the "served" state through their respective message exchanges.

This tests multi-client single-server message patterns.
