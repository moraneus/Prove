Example 44: Property TRUE Constant (Edge Case)
=================================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 4
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

The property is the constant TRUE, which is satisfied regardless of the
trace content. This tests the tool's handling of trivial tautological
properties.

Edge case: tautological property.
