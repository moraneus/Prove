Example 12: Nested Yesterday
==============================
Processes: P1
Events: 5
Epsilon: default (infinity)
Expected verdict: SATISFIED

Tests the nested Yesterday operator @@phi, which looks two steps back.
At event e4 (prop "e"), @@ looks back to e2 which has prop "c".
So "e -> @@c" is satisfied.

This tests double application of the Yesterday operator.
