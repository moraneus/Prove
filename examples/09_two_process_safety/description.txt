Example 09: Two-Process Safety
================================
Processes: P1, P2
Events: 5
Epsilon: 2.0
Expected verdict: VIOLATED

P1 goes through init -> ready -> confirmed, while P2 goes init -> done.
The property requires that whenever "done" holds, "confirmed" must have
been true since "ready". However, "done" on P2 occurs before "confirmed"
on P1 in some linearizations, so the property is violated.

This tests a cross-process safety property.
